# Hello There!

My name is Marla Stemper and I am currently an Administrative Analyst for a large geothermal power company based in Reno, NV.
However, I recently discovered SQL and other data analysis procedures and something clicked! It's basically math with words and I have always been good at both. 
I decided to change career paths and pursue this new dream. Coming from years of experience in Administrative and Accounting roles as well as a degree in Managerial and Organization Communication, 
I never thought I would say that, but here I am. Excited to take this new step into data analysis!

**FUN FACTS** ðŸ˜Š
- I love the outdoors. Anything from camping to fishing to off-roading, being outside is my happy place.
- My current favorite hobbies include cooking, playing pickleball, and reading..
- I am an extroverted introvert. Meaning that I get reenergized from time alone, but I can be a real talker! Let's chat!
